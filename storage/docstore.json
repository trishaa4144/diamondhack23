In general, campus concerts are offered primarily for the enjoyment of students, faculty, and staff of the University.   Therefore the targeted proportion of non-campus versus campus attendance will be no greater than 50/50 for most  concert events.  Exceptions may be made, such as for the City of College Park Independence Day concert and Maryland  Day, depending upon unique circumstances, but campus facilities and resources should primarily support campus  events.\n\n6.       For large concerts, special steps will be taken to target this proportion through the control of ticket distribution and  access via venue entrances.\n\n     a.       Access to ticket distribution to favor student participation will include a combination of efforts related to the timing of releasing tickets to non-students, price differentials for non-students, and limitations on advertising as appropriate.  For example, tickets may be made available to students and faculty/staff in advance of a general release to the public with no more than two tickets permitted per University ID.  Then remaining tickets equaling no more than the number sold to students and other campus personnel could be released more broadly.\n\n     b.      Access to the event will be limited to ticket holders only.\n\n7.       For all medium and large concerts sound will be monitored at designated locations at the edge of campus with decibel  meters owned and operated by University staff.  Readings will be taken before the start of the concert and during the  event.  Information gleaned from these readings will be relayed back to the concert sound control point for volume  adjustment as appropriate.\n\n8.       There will be no more than 12 medium-sized concerts and no more than 2 large outdoor concerts per semester.\n\n9.       In cases where it is clear that sound disturbance is not at issue, exceptions may be made to this policy by the Director  of the Adele H. Stamp Student Union \u2013 Center for Campus Life or his/her designee.  Such approval will be predicated  upon the event sponsor\u2019s understanding of and willingness and ability to comply with these guidelines.\n\n10.   Contracts with performers will carry provisions which specify that volume control will be at the discretion of the event  sponsor in compliance with institutional policies and may be monitored and adjusted as needed by the institution.   Contracts with performers will also indicate the required starting and ending time for the concert.\n\n11.   All concerts and major entertainment events held in the Adele H. Stamp Student Union \u2013 Center for Campus Life are  required to use the ticketing services of the Stamp Ticket office to insure that attendance is limited to the approved  occupancy capacity as determined by the University Fire Marshal.\n\nCO-SPONSORING\n\nThe Stamp encourages collaborations and co-sponsorship's with other organizations within the university community and non-university entities based upon the following criteria.

Accordingly, the university will take whatever steps it deems necessary to:\n\n          i.         Protect the right of any individual or organization to demonstrate and publicly proclaim any view, however unpopular; and\n\n          ii.

Where an invited speaker is the object of protest, persons may demonstrate and/or leaflet outside the building  where the speech is taking place. Persons who wish to enter the building must do so as members of the audience  and must give the speaker a respectful hearing. Failure to grant the speaker a respectful hearing may result in the  offending persons being asked to leave. Signs, placards or similar paraphernalia associated with a demonstration  will not be carried into the building.\n\n     f.        The safety and wellbeing of members of the campus community collectively and individually must be protected  at all times. The university maintains the right to define the time, place and manner in which activities occur on  campus.

Student organizations sponsoring or organizing demonstrations, rallies, leafleting or equivalent activities will  be held responsible for compliance with this policy. Student organization sponsorship in no way relieves  participating individuals of responsibility for their conduct. Each individual participating in a demonstration or  equivalent activities, whether sponsored or not, is accountable for compliance with the provisions of this policy  as well as the Code of Student Conduct. Complaints of violation of this policy may be grounds for disciplinary  action against individuals and/or the sponsoring or participating student organizations and their officers.\n\n     k.       Although persons who are not members of the university student body, faculty or staff may participate in  demonstrations, rallies, leafleting or equivalent activities upon invitation by a bona fide student, faculty or staff  member engaged in such activity, all non-university participants are obligated to the terms of this policy. Persons  who invite non-university participants may be held accountable for such participant's compliance with this  policy. In addition, since non-university participants are not subject to university discipline procedures, their  failure to comply with this policy may result in appropriate action under State and Federal law.\n\n2.       Special Guidelines for Scheduled Demonstrations\n\n     a.        Recognized university organizations, full or part-time students and current employees of the university who  wish to schedule a demonstration, rally or equivalent activity, may request the space through the regular  reservation procedure. Any such request must be made no less than one (1) business day in advance of the  activity. Stamp Event & Guest Services will respond promptly to any reservation request.

McKeldin Mall\n\n          iI.     Hornbake Plaza\n\n          iii.     Adele H. Stamp Student Union (South East Plaza) for literature distributions\n\n          iv.     Nyumburu Amphitheatre\n\n     b.      Demonstrations may be held at other locations on campus with the approval of the Vice President for Student  Affairs or her/his designee on a first-come, first-serve basis after an assessment that such demonstrations will not  otherwise interfere with scheduled university use or fail to comply with the guidelines applicable to all  demonstrations.\n\n3.       Special Guidelines for Unscheduled Demonstrations\n\n     a.       It is the intent of this policy to ensure that all demonstrations on campus occur with minimal threat to the safety  and security of persons or facilities through proper planning and scheduling. Occasionally, an event may occur  which demands immediate public outcry, and it is not the intent of this policy to limit students\u2019 rights to protest  such events.\n\n     b.      Unscheduled demonstrations, rallies, or equivalent activities may be held by recognized university  organizations, full or part-time students and current employees of the university in the areas defined above,  provided that the activity does not interfere with any functions for which that space has been reserved in advance.\n\n     c.       However, it is inappropriate for events that have been planned to circumvent the policies by claiming to be  spontaneous. In deciding whether a demonstration is spontaneous or planned the university may consider any  relevant evidence, including (a) whether signs or placards used at the demonstration were commercially  produced, (b) whether participants used amplification equipment, (c) whether security was alerted, or media  contacted, substantially in advance of the demonstration, or (d) whether other circumstances demonstrate  advance planning by one or more organizers.\n\n4.       Special Guidelines for Small Demonstrations\n\n     a.       Demonstrations or equivalent activities by ten (10) or fewer students, faculty or staff may occur at any outdoor  area without advance reservation. Except with respect to location, such demonstrations are subject to the same  policy guidelines applicable to larger demonstrations. Accordingly, the university encourages all persons  planning a demonstration or equivalent activity to call or visit Event & Guest Services to discuss those policy  guidelines and how they might apply to the demonstration being planned.\n\n5.       Special Guidelines for Leafleting\n\n     a.       University students, faculty and staff may distribute, without registration or advance approval, non-commercial  announcements, statements or materials in any outdoor area of the campus, the use of which is not otherwise  restricted or scheduled. Persons distributing such materials are expected to refrain from littering and may be held  responsible for costs incurred as a result of littering. Distribution is defined as individuals handing materials to  other individuals who may accept them or refrain from receiving them. Leaving materials unattended on a  surface to be picked up is considered littering, not distribution. For purposes of this provision, announcements,  statements or materials pertaining to the sale of goods or services authorized by the university administration are  considered non-commercial.\n\n6.       Special Guidelines for Parades\n\n     a.       Demonstrations in the form of parades on streets may be conducted with the specific approval of route and time.
